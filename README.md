    2.  A 30-day sentiment history chart.
    3.  A merged, dual-axis chart comparing price action directly against daily sentiment.
* **Interactive Frontend**: A clean and modern user interface built with **vanilla JavaScript** allows users to select stocks from categorized dropdowns (by industry).
* **Efficient Caching**: Employs a **SQLite** database to cache the results of daily predictions, preventing redundant API calls and ensuring a fast user experience on subsequent requests for the same stock.
